# NOTE: Use of pipe | in regular expressions

# â€œThe | character is called a pipe. You can use it anywhere you want
# to match one of many expressions. For example, the regular
# expression r'Batman|Tina Fey' will match either 'Batman' or
# 'Tina Fey'.

# When both Batman and Tina Fey occur in the searched string,
# the first occurrence of matching text will be returned as
# the Match object.
